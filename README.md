# ✈ Analysis of British Airways Customer Reviews

## 📌 Overview
In this project, I analyzed customer reviews of British Airways using NLP techniques to uncover trends, key topics, and major factors impacting on their satisfaction. I used topic modelling to present the key themes from the reviews to capture both complaints and compliments.
