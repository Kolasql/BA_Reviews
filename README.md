Brtish Airways customer review analysis with LDA. Key topic extracted and showed using word clouds.
# ✈ Analysis of British Airways Customer Reviews

## 📌 Overview
In this project, I analyzed customer reviews of British Airways using NLP techniques to uncover trends, key topics, and major factors impacting on their satisfaction. I used topic modelling to present the key themes from the reviews to capture both complaints and compliments.

## 📊 Dataset
- *Source:* British Airways customer review dataset
- *Features:*
  - verify: verification of the review
  - review: customers' feedback 
  - date: Review date

  - recommended: whether customer recommended the airline
  - stars: customers's rating of the airline's service
  - departure: place of airplane departure
  - arrival: Arrival experience rating
  - type_of_traveller: the type of traveller using the airline

## 🎯 Objectives
- *Identify key themes* (e.g., flight delays, baggage issues, customer service).
- *Visualize sentiment distribution* across different categories.
- *Provide actionable insights* for airline service improvement.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- *Programming Language:* Python 🐍
- *Libraries Used:*
  - NLP: NLTK
  - Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
  - Machine Learning (if applicable): Scikit-learn, TF-IDF, Transformers, LatentDirichletAllocation

## 🚀 Methodology
1. *Data Preprocessing* 🛠
   - Removed missing values
   - Text cleaning (lowercasing, removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters)
   - Tokenization and lemmatization

3. *Topic Modeling* 🏷
   - Used LDA to extract common topics from reviews

4. *Data Visualization* 📊
   - Sentiment distribution (positive, neutral, negative)
   - Most common words in negative reviews (word cloud)
   - Ratings vs. sentiment correlation

## 📈 Key Insights
